## Intent

Define a consistent technology to be used for client code generation from OpenAPI specifications.

## Motivation

* Have a uniform and good quality SDK layer to be used for APIs access
* Be able to maintain the generated code and the necessary libraries
* Ability to fix bugs and eventually improve the generator codebase

## Applicability

This pattern applies to any service using a client/SDK to access REST API endpoints.

Exceptions are:
 - a service is already successfully using an alternative generator
 - a service is using the current `quarkus-openapi-extension` (the current plan is to move the extension to use Kiota as well)

## Description

We propose to use OSS tooling provided by Microsoft called https://github.com/microsoft/kiota[Kiota] for client and SDKs generations.

To apply Kiota in a project follow the https://microsoft.github.io/kiota/get-started/[Official "Get Started" guides].

## Participants

The DevExp team is currently providing SDKs for all of the MAS services, all of them will be converted to use Kiota and serve as an example that can be applied more broadly.

## Trade-offs

PROS:
* consistency across languages
* great OSS support from Microsoft
* generated code doesn't depend on specific dependencies
* tooling is easy to use
* generated code is high quality
* auth mechanism is very flexible

CONS:
* the CLI is written in .NET and might be hard to nicely embed it
* is not yet GA (will be soon)
* scarce extra tooling provided by third-party
