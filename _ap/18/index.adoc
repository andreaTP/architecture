== Context and Problem Statement

We are internally committed to using OpenAPI specification and encourage our customers to do the same with products like API Designer and Service Registry.

The current approach to automatically generating client SDKs for Red Hat's application services has a number of problems/issues that need to be holistically addressed.
This AP will document the challenges with our current approach and propose a solution using new technologies.

In client-server architectures, servers are written using either a contract-first or code-first approach.
However, we always have the need to interact with those APIs from clients.
Generation of the API clients can (and should) be completely automated.
This represents a contract-first approach to creating API clients.

We do generate/write clients for several purposes, the most relevant are:

* Service SDKs
* CLI tools
* UI (e.g. console.dot)
* Provisioning Tools (Ansible, Terraform)

Most of our toolchains are (in some ways) using openapi-generator, the official tool supported by the OpenAPI org.

Unfortunately, OpenAPI Generator is not a well maintained OSS project:

Even our own attempts to fix known bugs have been ineffective:
https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/pull/13616

It's also pretty common to have breaking changes in the generator tooling, which results in breaking changes in the generated code.
When this happens it can be hard to detect and often happens without a clear migration path.

For these reasons we are often https://github.com/redhat-developer/app-services-sdk-go/blob/13d1cad9a937c456a9623ad188c44790e3370d83/openapitools.json#L5[stuck on old versions], preventing (in some cases) the opportunity to fix CVEs and issues by keeping transitive dependencies and used frameworks updated.

Following are a variety of critical/important issues we currently have due to our OpenAPI Generator based approach to API Client generation.

=== Security

We should be able to keep our dependency trees under control and update/refresh whenever a vulnerability in the stack is detected.

=== Technical debt

We want to be able to improve the quality of the generated clients and SDKs and improve them over time, introducing even structural bug fixes and improvements.  Overall we strive for our code to be well structured and maintainable, even when that code is being generated (to the best extent possible).

=== Community

We want our community of customers to be able to use best-in-class tools to perform their day-to-day work. OpenAPI generation is an important piece of tooling and we should be able to provide a much better OSS experience than the one we are right now.

== Goals

* Identify alternative tooling that can be used in place of the current OpenAPI generator
* Validate and improve the integration patterns and the user experience
* Use up-to-date tooling and libraries for our customer-facing API clients

== Non-goals

* Dictate a technical decision for internal usage or for projects that are successfully rolling their own SDKs and clients (e.g. by manually curating them)

== Current Architecture

Inside Red Hat we are mostly relying (in various ways) on OpenAPI Generator to generate clients, we also maintain a https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-openapi-generator[Quarkus Extension] based on the same generator.

== Proposed Architecture

We propose to switch to alternative OSS tooling provided by Microsoft called https://github.com/microsoft/kiota[Kiota].

=== Advantages:

* Community
* Better design/architecture
* Better developer experience
* Maintenance
* Swappable implementation libraries
* Compatibility matrix

=== Disadvantages:

* Not GA (yet)
* External Owners (Microsoft)
* Core Generator codebase is .NET

==== Community

The responses in the community are quick and provide context https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-java/issues/121#issuecomment-1372248993[above expectations].

Collaboration is actively fostered and contributing to both the core generator and the auxiliary libraries is facilitated and encouraged with active and timely feedback.

Cross-project integrations are facilitated and https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/discussions/2154[healthy conversations] are initiated on both (RH and Microsoft) sides.

==== Better design/architecture

Kiota design is extremely principled and follows https://microsoft.github.io/kiota/extending/[good and detailed guidelines] throughout the project.
The project leadership shows broad and deep experience in building successful code generators, which are pragmatic and extensible.

==== Better developer experience

The project's architectural design decisions are supported and embraced throughout all of the different implementations so that the user is going to have a consistent and uniform experience while using the generated code across different languages.
Additionally, the fluent code style of the generated clients provides a better experience for consumers, resulting in higher levels of developer joy.

==== Maintenance

Experience shows that issues are answered within hours, PRs are continuously accepted and merged, and guidance is provided when needed.

Transitive dependencies are kept up to date in a timely manner.

Improvements and bugs are continuously integrated into both the generator and the auxiliary libraries' repositories.

==== Swappable implementation libraries

The design of Kiota allows consumers of the code generator to provide their own https://microsoft.github.io/kiota/extending/corelibrary.html[“opinionated” implementations] of core generated client functionality.
This is done via a set of interfaces to core functionality that all generated clients leverage (e.g. a Java HTTP client interface).  Default implementations of these interfaces are provided, but alternatives can easily be created and used.

Specifically for the Red Hat use case, we are free to roll out our own implementations of the core libraries to better support Red Hat products and strategy (e.g. Quarkus specific implementations of certain functionality).

Creating alternatives for the provided default libraries is doable in a very reasonable amount of time.
https://github.com/andreaTP/kiota-utils/blob/1a7dcecd92ce8794fe479e9c37c71d5733a39ff6/http/jdk-http/src/main/java/io/apicurio/kiota/http/JdkHttpRequestAdapter.java#L1[Here] you can find an alternative implementation of the Java HttpClient interface that is based on the client embedded in JDK 11+ (vs. the out-of-the-box implementation that is based on OkHttp).

In the long term, we expect that most of the bug fixes are going to happen in those shared libraries, and being able to maintain and release them at our own pace is a key element for success.

==== Compatibility matrix

Kiota https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/issues/2020[compatibility matrix] covers the current Red Hat use-cases, specifically:

* Java
* Go
* Python
* TypeScript

The generator doesn't need to stitch or even know about specific frameworks and/or libraries as they rely only on interfaces (called “abstractions”), and implementation libraries are swappable.

==== External Owners (Microsoft)

The project is maintained and owned by Microsoft, specifically by the team working on Microsoft Graph.
We will be having some direct discussions with them soon around their plans for the project and a possible collaboration.
Initial impressions indicate that they are very receptive to improvements and collaborations.
But, of course, they will always own the project in the same way that Red Hat owns our first-party OSS projects.

On the flip side, this is a possible occasion for a strong collaboration between two of the major players in the Software industry that can drive more and more community adoption of the technology/stack.

Using OpenAPI Tools we are in a very similar situation except from the fact that it's more a "pure" Open Source project.

==== Legal Requirements (Terms Acceptance and Export Control)

Kiota and the relevant component are released under the MIT license.

=== Additional Reading

Kiota design: https://microsoft.github.io/kiota/extending/
Some libraries are already used [in Red Hat projects](https://github.com/microsoft/kiota-abstractions-go/network/dependents).

=== Threat Model

image::threat-model.png[]

* Given that Kiota is going to produce source code and runs on the client side there are no specific threats for RH SaaS
* A Code Generator could produce malicious or corrupted generated code.
* Clients with large numbers of dependencies could be vulnerable if not refreshed
* A swapped implementation may not be well supported

=== Alternatives Considered / Rejected

==== Keep going with the current generator

The DevExp team has identified as a major piece of maintenance the upgrade of the currently outdated https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator[openapi-generator].
The current SDKs are full of quirks and edge cases in most cases hacked around to end up with a working implementation.
Having to keep the https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fwmRmapDdFRU-B7qFBUuXyHMDjzXtRMY-jhbtxDVtyU/edit#gid=0[hacks and workarounds] is a major blocker to updating toward newer versions of the generator.

The monolithic approach to a generation used by openapi-generator also offers challenges in a modular approach to bug fixes and improvements.

==== IBM

We have had extensive discussions with IBM regarding their approach to https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cloud-sdk-common[client SDK] generation and we very much like their governance model over APIs produced in the company.
The IBM openapi-codegen(closed source) is a fork of the “official” generator.
IBM does maintain an https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/api-handbook[API Handbook] and they verify the compatibility running the tooling on all of their OpenApi specifications (similar to what is explained https://github.com/microsoft/kiota/issues/2020[in this open ticket for Kiota]).

==== Per language tooling

There are a number of independent projects to generate code specifically for one language (often written in the same).
On average those tools are much better than the “official” openapi-generator counterpart, but it is extremely challenging to provide a cohesive result out of disparate tools for the users and engage with various communities at different levels of maturity/openness.

=== Challenges

* There are improvements to be done and we would require to publish alternative core libraries to fully integrate the experience and the support.

=== Consequences if Not Completed

* It will be extremely hard to fix timely security issues in the current SDKs, Clients, UIs
* It's almost impossible to contribute to the design and implement new features for the client-generated code
